  "summary": "The diff appears to implement the requested Help Center tile centering and hover tooltip, but it also introduces additional (unrequested) scroll-cue behavior/UX in HelpCenter and includes edits to non-required metadata/docs files. No clear missing requirements can be confirmed from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [],

    {
      "description": "Added Help Center nested scroll cue behavior/UX (scroll container ref + scroll cue hook) beyond the requested tile centering and hover title tooltip.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits changes to the specified tile centering and hover tooltip behavior and asks not to change application logic/behavior beyond those visual adjustments. The diff shows new hook usage and related state for scroll cues.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/pages/HelpCenter.tsx (imports useRef/useScrollCues; scrollContainerRef and canScrollUp/canScrollDown/hasScrolled usage shown)"

    {
      "description": "Modified project metadata/state tracking file (project_state.json).",
      "reason": "Not requested by the BuildRequest, which constrained the change to frontend Help Center tile styling/tooltip behavior.",

    {
      "description": "Modified frontend-file-summaries.txt (documentation/summary content).",
